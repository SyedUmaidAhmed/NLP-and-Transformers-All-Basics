Today, computers controlling sophisticated electronics oversee the \\nmilking process. Everything has changed. The cow, which is the subject of this study, has been \\ngenetically improved, but basically, it is the same cow. There was a time when we produced milk \\nto provide us with something to eat. Today, here in Israel, and in many other dairying countries, \\nmilk is not only a basic foodstuff; it is the raw material for a vast range of milk-based products. \\nThen and now, the dairy industry keeps the farmer chained to his tasks 24 hours a day and that is \\nthe reason why we must continue searching for ways to provide the farmer and the cow with a  \\nmore comfortable and efficient lifestyle.  \\nThis is not a dry scientific work filled with facts and references; it does not present all the facts. \\nThis is an a\\nttempt to present examples and practical solutions for the day to day operation of a \\ndair\\ny, spiced with the appropriate solutions of scientific thinking. I can only hope that I have \\nsucce\\neded and that is for the reader to judge.  \\nUnderstand this: The various models published by committees in different countries around the \\nworld ar\\ne from my point of view, something akin to travel guides for tourists. Whereas practical \\nplanning will\\n make use of the model, it must always take into account the limitations imposed by \\ntime and space. Reality will present the user with something different, which very often; will not \\nconform precisely to the model.  \\nAn expert in nutrition once reacted to a statement I made with: “Where is that written down?”  \\n My response: \\n “It is my personal knowledge gained through experience. I do not act without reason; there will \\nalways be a scientific background accompanied by an additional dimension garnered through \\npractical experience. If I was wrong, I learned the lesson taught thereby and reached the \\nappropriate conclusions. I believe in this method as the best way forward. “ \\nWe have learned of the global trend towards fewer and larger herds to think differently. \\nRe\\ngrettably, professional literature (and a limited number of studies) provides insufficient data \\nabout\\n herd nutrition.

The fore-stomach is a large fermentation tanks about one third the size of the cow’s \\ne\\nntire body. Traditionally, the fore-stomach is divided into three parts: Rumen, reticulum and \\nomasum. Most of the microbial activities take place in the first two stomachs, the rumen and the \\nreticulum; the omasum squeezes the semi-digested food before moved it into the true stomach. \\n“Rumen” is the term referring  to the three parts of the fore-stomach. The fourth in this series of \\nstomachs is the true stomach, which constitutes a mere 7% of the entire stomach system and it \\nfunctions in a manner similar to that of all other animals (except for some slight differences in \\nbirds).  \\nMothers teach their children to chew before swallowing. Ruminants do it the other way round. \\nThey swallow, fill the rumen and only then find somewhere safe and comfortable to rest, \\nregurgitate their cud and chew. (It is likely that this is a defense mechanism against predators. \\nAssumi\\nng that in nature, food could be found principally in exposed grassy areas, they could \\nhide to digest the gathered food.)  \\nFood consumed without chewing causes finely sliced food particles to sink to the bottom of the \\nrumen, while longer fibers float and/or sink only slightly into the rumen juices. The longer pieces \\nof food create a latticed layer which prevents the smaller particles from sinking quickly to the \\nbottom of the rumen and passing into the duodenum and small intestine before they can be \\nbr\\noken down by the microorganisms. Once further along into the system, they cannot be broken \\ndown and in their undigested form, they pass into the feces.  \\nThe cow copes with foods rich in long fibers by having it spend a longer time in the rumen.  This \\ng\\nives the microorganism populations in the rumen enough time to break down larger quantities \\nbefore it leaves the rumen and enters the other sections of the digestive system. The extended \\ndelay also contributes to the rise in digestibility and it improves the digestibility of the entire \\ndiet. \\nFood breakdown in the rumen creates methane and carbon dioxide, which although not digested, \\ncannot be found in the feces. This must be taken into account when conducting digestion \\nexperiments.  \\nLong fiber food stimulates the area where the esophagus meets the rumen and the reaction to that \\nstimulation is similar to the process that occurs when a human vomits.

Next, the cud stimulates the animal to secrete \\nsaliva which contains salts that regulate the rumen’s acidity.

Microorganism bodies, built up from the broken down food.\\n2. Acids and ammonia, defined as “waste”, which can absorbed and exploited by the\\nmicroorganisms and/or the ruminant. \\n3. Gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide.\\n4. Heat that is created during the fermentation process.\\n5. Remnants of undigested food, such as undigested fibers, which are excreted in the feces or\\nprotein compounds that have survived the microorganisms’ activities. After reaching the \\nintestine they can be digested by animals.  This will be discussed in the section dealing with \\nproteins.  \\nThe food components which may be used by the cow include microorganisms, the “fermentation \\nwastes” and the residual protein. Heat and gases usually constitute a danger for ru minants and \\nthey must be disposed of by expelling them from the body. After expulsion from the animal, they \\nbecome environmental hazards. Real digestion will be discussed later because it is a vital factor \\nin the understanding of the digestive process and nutrition.  \\nThe vital importance of long fibers lies in the way that they prevent the accelerated flow of food \\nthrough the digestive system, which in turn improves digestibility and helps save the lives of the \\ncattle. Alternatively, too much long fiber food in the diet has a detrimental effect on food \\nconsumption as the rumen fills more and the flow of food slows down. Consequently, there is a \\ndrop in the quantity of food passing into the intestines for digestion and a drop in production. \\nProper balance is necessary for good nutrition. Balance means the correct ratio between the \\ndifferent sources of food in order to maintain the required level of food consumption, without \\nharming digestibility. Food consumption rates is one of the limiting factors in ruminant nutrition \\nDigestibility and food consumption sometimes appear to be contradictory. The secret of good \\nnutrition is to find the balance between the two. (A healthy, producing cow needs 550 - 600 \\nminutes in ev\\nery 24 hours to regurgitate cud).

It is \\ncustom\\nary to examine the components of this system through the structure of cell walls and the \\nadhesive that keeps them together. The basic structure of food fibers comprises a chain of carbon \\n(C) atoms, with hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms alongside the carbon. The links within the\\nchains and the strength of those links, determine the nature and properties of the substance. \\nStarch  is a carbon fiber, which breaks down relatively easily in an aqueous environment or it \\ncan be broken down by enzymatic activity in the digestive system. In plants, starch serves as the \\nenergy reservoir stored in seeds to ensure germination. When the seed is supplied as a foodstuff, \\nstarch constitutes a good, rapidly available source of energy for the animal. Starch from different \\nvegetative sources has slightly different properties. Wheat and barley starches break down \\nrapidly in the rumen’s aqueous environment and make major contributions as a source of energy \\nfor microbial activity. Maize (corn) and sorghum starches break down slower and therefore, they \\npersist longer, which means that most of the absorption of those starches into the body is through \\nthe intestines where they serve as available energy sources. Fine chopping of maize and sorghum \\ngrains into very small pieces increases the rate at which they are absorbed through the intestine.  \\nCellulose , which has a basic structure similar to that of starch (C 6H12O6) n and hemicellulose (a \\ndifferent chain, which contains a combination of 5 and 6 atoms of carbon) are more stable and \\ntheir breakdown is dependent upon the populations of microorganisms in the rumen.  \\nLignin  is another component in fiber, present in much lower quantities, but has a powerful effect \\non both the plant and digestibility. Lignin is not a carbohydrate in the commonly accepted sense. \\nLignin is a complex structure, or a chain of rings, some of which contain nitrogen. Lignin has a \\nmuch more\\n stable structure than cellulose and hemicellulose; lignin is not digested. (During the \\ndiscussion of proteins, we will explain that anything which is not lignin, but is close to or and/or \\nbound to lig\\nnin such as the nitrogen in the rings, also has degraded digestibility). Lignin levels in \\nplants rise with the plants’ age; accordingly, young plants have much higher digestibility than \\nmature plants, notwithstanding the fact that laboratory tests often characterize these fiber \\ncomponents as carbohydrates; no difference is apparent between the different plants. Research \\ninto lignin is somewhat problematic because we don’t always know if it appears in specific \\nlocations in the plant or is dispersed throughout the plant. (If lignin is dispersed within the plant \\ntissues, the \\nplant links relatively greater percentages of digestible plant parts to the lignin, when \\ncompared with that found in plants with lignin as a continuous physical presence).  \\nOther food components, such as fat and protein are found within the cell itself and shall be \\ndiscussed separately.

After \\nasking where the alfalfa had come from, I was told that it came from Utah, a state which benefits \\nfrom a dryer, colder climate than Florida.

It is also true that even in small countries like Israel; \\nthere are no similarities between northern and southern plants.

The ADL/ADF ratio, which is a good enough \\nex\\npression of fiber digestibility for the plants harvested at the flowering stage, was 18.05 on the \\nmountain plain and 20.40 for the valley crop.

Part of the protein survives the rumen and is whole when it \\nreaches the intestines, where it is digested by the animal’s enzymes. Some of the protein that \\nsurvives the rumen can be degradable protein, which was not digested due to the rapid flow \\nthrough the system. Protein reaching the intestine undergoes digestion by enzymes in a process \\nsimilar to single stomach animals. Protein is not digested in its entirety in the intestine for a \\nnumber of reasons: \\n1. Due to the speed at which food is washed out of the rumen and passes through the\\ndigestive system, the degradable protein can continue on and flow out in the feces. \\n2. Protein bound to lignin (ADIN) cannot be utilized.\\n To complete this process, it is important to mention the wear and tear caused by the passage of \\nfood through the digestive system. Body protein worn away from the walls of the digestive \\nsystem passageways, together with the enzymes secreted from the body, constitute between 3% \\nand 5% of the nitrogen in the feces (metabolic fecal nitrogen) and the rougher the ration (straw) \\nthe higher the quantity of nitrogen excreted. On the farm, it is customary to disregard the value \\nof fo ods containing up to 3% protein as a source of protein.  They are sometimes listed in the \\nrati\\non planning charts as having zeroed or negative protein value.  The protein that is present is \\nineffic\\nient, residual protein. To complete the picture of nitrogen balance in the body, we must \\nmention the excretion of nitrogen in the urine, which is the byproduct of metabolic processes in \\nthe body and not only the excess nitrogen excreted as urea. The quantity of metabolic waste \\n(endogenic nitrogen) is not large, but must be taken into account when conducting digestion \\nexperiments.    \\nNotwithstanding the fact that food protein is essentially a carbon chain, it is an inefficient source \\nof energy. Protein’s vita l role in food is to build body tissues and help produce milk; it is not \\nworthwhile to provide protein in food as a source of energy. Protein is an inefficient source of \\nenergy because despite the fact that it is an energetic material, it breaks down into an \\nintermediate material – non-protein nitrogen, which contains some of the energy intrinsic to the \\nprotein (equivalent to some 1.25 Kilocalories for each gram of digested protein) and most of the \\nnon-protein nitrogen is in the form of urea. Although rich in nitrogen like protein, the urea \\nmolecule has no residual oxygen, which could to a degree, serve as a food substrate for the \\nrumen populations to make microbial protein.  The residue comprises short chain molecules, \\nwhich are absorbed to a not inconsiderable degree through the rumen walls into the bloodstream \\nand they are not utilized either as a source of energy or as a source of nitrogen in the making of \\nmicroorganism protein.

Current knowledge allows us to \\ndifferentiate between the three types of protein mentioned above: Rapidly broken down soluble \\nprotein, degradable protein and survives protein. The most practical recommendation for ration \\npreparation is to provide all three types in a 1:1:1 ratio. Rumen populations (assuming a ration \\nbalanced for fiber and available energy) have the ability to exploit the two sources of protein that \\nbreak down in the rumen for microbial protein. Unfortunately, this capability has limitations.  \\nOne third of the protein supplied in the ration, which is the proportion that survives the rumen, is \\nexploited by the animal using the enzymatic system and it does not exploit the non-utilizable \\nprotein (ADIN).  \\nFor any given nutritional composition in a ration, advanced models can be used to calculate the \\ntotal amount of protein absorbed through the intestine, which comprises utilizable residual \\nprotein and microbial protein. This combination, together with various models used to predict the \\ncomposition and quantities of different amino acids absorbed into the body, expresses the real \\nvalue of the protein in the food, which is then defined as Metabolic Protein – MP.  \\nThe dairy farmer should plan the supply of protein in the ration by calculating the Metabolic \\nProtein value of the food. Unfortunately, in many circumstances it can only be used for the \\ntheoretical examination of the ration, using different models.  \\n“A veterinarian very interested in nutrition models once called me and asked:  ‘If a ration for \\ncalves needed no more than 12% overall protein to provide all the required Metabolic Protein, \\nwh\\ny are we wasting protein and providing 13% - 14% crude protein in the calf ration?’ We met \\nand together we examined an advanced model.

For example: Soya protein breaks down in the rumen slower \\nthan alfalfa protein. On the surface, that would imply that it is a better protein. In fact, it is the \\nalfalfa protein, which contributes more to the production of microbial protein than the soya \\nprotein. Therefore, the soya protein is exploited less efficiently, and relative large percentages of \\nsoya protein pass into the bloodstream and the body as ammonia. During digestion experiments, \\nit is included as digested material, but its artificial digestibility makes no contribution to the \\nsupply of either energy or protein to the animal.  Such proteins even consume energy to expedite \\nits excretion in the urine or in the milk. In other words, we can reasonably say that soya protein \\n(and similar foods with greater effect, such as gluten feed and others) makes a relatively large \\ncontribution to the artificial digestibility compartment.     \\nThe nitrogen cycle within the body does not result in the excretion of all the surplus nitrogen in \\nthe urine. Som\\ne nitrogen returns through the saliva into the rumen. Nitrogen in the saliva joins \\nthe overall nitrogen in the rumen, most of which comes from the food. Some of the nitrogen was \\nin the food when it was consumed at the feeding trough (even alfalfa protein contains a certain \\namount of ammonia). The remaining nitrogen, which is also the larger quantity, is real food \\nnitrogen, which was broken down in the rumen because rumen microorganisms had neither the \\nenergy nor sufficient time (due to fast breakdown rate and speed of digesta flow through the \\ndigestive system) to use the ammonia to make microbial protein. \\nMany of us now have a practical tool to estimate artificial digestibility –measuring the quantity \\nof urea in the milk. The starting point for this process is as explained above: The ammonia and \\nnitrogen in the rumen not used to create microbial protein.
