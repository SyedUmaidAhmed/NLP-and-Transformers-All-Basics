Today, computers controlling sophisticated electronics oversee the \nmilking process. Everything has changed. The cow, which is the subject of this study, has been \ngenetically improved, but basically, it is the same cow. There was a time when we produced milk \nto provide us with something to eat. Today, here in Israel, and in many other dairying countries, \nmilk is not only a basic foodstuff; it is the raw material for a vast range of milk-based products. \nThen and now, the dairy industry keeps the farmer chained to his tasks 24 hours a day and that is \nthe reason why we must continue searching for ways to provide the farmer and the cow with a  \nmore comfortable and efficient lifestyle.  \nThis is not a dry scientific work filled with facts and references; it does not present all the facts. \nThis is an a\nttempt to present examples and practical solutions for the day to day operation of a \ndair\ny, spiced with the appropriate solutions of scientific thinking. I can only hope that I have \nsucce\neded and that is for the reader to judge.  \nUnderstand this: The various models published by committees in different countries around the \nworld ar\ne from my point of view, something akin to travel guides for tourists. Whereas practical \nplanning will\n make use of the model, it must always take into account the limitations imposed by \ntime and space. Reality will present the user with something different, which very often; will not \nconform precisely to the model.  \nAn expert in nutrition once reacted to a statement I made with: \u201cWhere is that written down?\u201d  \n My response: \n \u201cIt is my personal knowledge gained through experience. I do not act without reason; there will \nalways be a scientific background accompanied by an additional dimension garnered through \npractical experience. If I was wrong, I learned the lesson taught thereby and reached the \nappropriate conclusions. I believe in this method as the best way forward. \u201c \nWe have learned of the global trend towards fewer and larger herds to think differently. \nRe\ngrettably, professional literature (and a limited number of studies) provides insufficient data \nabout\n herd nutrition.

Single cell organisms of various types (bacteria, protozoa, etc.) help break down \nthe vegetation eaten and use it to build their own bodily tissues. At the same time, they secrete \nvarious compounds into the stomach juices, conduct a vigorous sex life and propagate.   \nBiologists know how to characterize the different natural proteins (which are the building blocks \nfor all animal tissues) according to each protein\u2019s \u201cbiological value\u201d to the consuming animal, \nwhich a re used to measure the level of efficiency in which a food protein can replace the body\u2019s \nprotein. \nType of Protein  Biological Value  \nEgg 98% \nMilk  95% \nMeat  85% \nVegetable (Leaf)  70% \nVegetable (Legume)  50% \nMicroorganism  85%  \nThe biological value of microorganism protein is 85% , comparable to meat.   \nMicrobial Activities and Nutrition in the Ruminant \nDigestion breaks down the low value food protein into high value microbial protein.

We know that it is important \nto maintain balanced nutrition, and that the balance should be maintained unchanged over the \nlong term. Persistent nutrition is an important factor in dairy success.   \nThe modern, high yielding cow is essentially no different than its predecessors that gave only \nsmall quantities of milk sufficient to feed their offspring and depended on the availability of \nfood.  \nMan has learned to produce food products from the cow for human consumption through the \ncombined use of genetics, management and feeding.

The fore-stomach is a large fermentation tanks about one third the size of the cow\u2019s \ne\nntire body. Traditionally, the fore-stomach is divided into three parts: Rumen, reticulum and \nomasum. Most of the microbial activities take place in the first two stomachs, the rumen and the \nreticulum; the omasum squeezes the semi-digested food before moved it into the true stomach. \n\u201cRumen\u201d is the term referring  to the three parts of the fore-stomach. The fourth in this series of \nstomachs is the true stomach, which constitutes a mere 7% of the entire stomach system and it \nfunctions in a manner similar to that of all other animals (except for some slight differences in \nbirds).  \nMothers teach their children to chew before swallowing. Ruminants do it the other way round. \nThey swallow, fill the rumen and only then find somewhere safe and comfortable to rest, \nregurgitate their cud and chew. (It is likely that this is a defense mechanism against predators. \nAssumi\nng that in nature, food could be found principally in exposed grassy areas, they could \nhide to digest the gathered food.)  \nFood consumed without chewing causes finely sliced food particles to sink to the bottom of the \nrumen, while longer fibers float and/or sink only slightly into the rumen juices. The longer pieces \nof food create a latticed layer which prevents the smaller particles from sinking quickly to the \nbottom of the rumen and passing into the duodenum and small intestine before they can be \nbr\noken down by the microorganisms. Once further along into the system, they cannot be broken \ndown and in their undigested form, they pass into the feces.  \nThe cow copes with foods rich in long fibers by having it spend a longer time in the rumen.  This \ng\nives the microorganism populations in the rumen enough time to break down larger quantities \nbefore it leaves the rumen and enters the other sections of the digestive system. The extended \ndelay also contributes to the rise in digestibility and it improves the digestibility of the entire \ndiet. \nFood breakdown in the rumen creates methane and carbon dioxide, which although not digested, \ncannot be found in the feces. This must be taken into account when conducting digestion \nexperiments.  \nLong fiber food stimulates the area where the esophagus meets the rumen and the reaction to that \nstimulation is similar to the process that occurs when a human vomits. The unprocessed food \nreturns to the mouth, where it is chewed and that process is repeated again and again. The cud \nre\ngurgitation process serves a number of very important purposes.  \nsponsored by the Israeli dairy School\nPage 9 of 28", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf4e26b4-6eff-4ad7-9d2f-67fd2ba927a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf4e26b4-6eff-4ad7-9d2f-67fd2ba927a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Dairy-Herd-Nutrition-Management_chapter_1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\TESLA LAPTOPS\\Documents\\llama_rag_project\\data\\Dairy-Herd-Nutrition-Management_chapter_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1190874, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21740914-3050-49f5-afe1-bbbb7f459429", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Dairy-Herd-Nutrition-Management_chapter_1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\TESLA LAPTOPS\\Documents\\llama_rag_project\\data\\Dairy-Herd-Nutrition-Management_chapter_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1190874, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-20"}, "hash": "a2849359ad0df9de8c6e6a314f2c5fb68a2e614131fb41a6a1dbb0322a679872", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "First, the unprocessed food returns to the mouth for chewing and slicing and during that process, \nit becomes accessible to the microorganisms. Next, the cud stimulates the animal to secrete \nsaliva which contains salts that regulate the rumen\u2019s acidity.

Microorganism bodies, built up from the broken down food.\n2. Acids and ammonia, defined as \u201cwaste\u201d, which can absorbed and exploited by the\nmicroorganisms and/or the ruminant. \n3.

This will be discussed in the section dealing with \nproteins.  \nThe food components which may be used by the cow include microorganisms, the \u201cfermentation \nwastes\u201d and the residual protein.

Alternatively, too much long fiber food in the diet has a detrimental effect on food \nconsumption as the rumen fills more and the flow of food slows down. Consequently, there is a \ndrop in the quantity of food passing into the intestines for digestion and a drop in production. \nProper balance is necessary for good nutrition. Balance means the correct ratio between the \ndifferent sources of food in order to maintain the required level of food consumption, without \nharming digestibility. Food consumption rates is one of the limiting factors in ruminant nutrition \nDigestibility and food consumption sometimes appear to be contradictory.

Food not \neaten will not be digested and will not make the expected contribution. Many factors combine to \ndetermine the quantity of food eaten. Every researcher and committee has its own formula, but \ndoes one formula fit every herd? \nMost of the advanced prediction formulae focus on cow\u2019s weight, milk yield and composition \n(more fat in the milk means more energy expelled from the body) and the lactation stage, all in \nan effort to cause a rise in consumption from the calving date up to 40 \u2013 60 lactation days, \nfollowed by a steady fall in consumption towards the drying off period. In order to simplify the \nvarious models, some do not include factors such as fiber content (NDF), source or texture. Most \nresearchers assume that cow performance in terms of milk yield, growth etc., are true \nexpressions of the ration and its composition and therefore, they see no need for specific \ncharacterization of the constituents in the ration.  \nThe physical structure of the ration (fiber length) influences consumption. Long fibers reduce \nfood consumption and the opposite is also true for chopping, particularly excessively short chop \nlength. When the chop length is too short, it can cause the opposite effect and lower consumption \ndue to higher stomach acidity, which reduces the level of microbial activity and in some \ncircumstances, can cause SARA (Sub-Acute Ruminal Acidosis). In more acute situations, it can \nlead to the death of the animal.  \nWhen food fat levels are higher than 5-7% of the total ration, digestibility is depressed and \nconsequentially, consumption drops. Climate, food delivery regimes (delivery frequency, how \noften it is pushed up the food given and the times during the day that these activities are \nperformed) contribute towards higher consumption as a function of the frequency at which they \nare performed. Feed push up and delivery timed close to the cows\u2019 exit from the milking parlor \nand their return to the feeders have particular importance. Food delivery during the cool hours in \nthe summer also contributes to higher consumption.  \nFor example: Two consumption prediction formulae: \nThe first formula is as recommended by the NRC 2001 committee.

It is \ncustom\nary to examine the components of this system through the structure of cell walls and the \nadhesive that keeps them together. The basic structure of food fibers comprises a chain of carbon \n(C) atoms, with hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms alongside the carbon. The links within the\nchains and the strength of those links, determine the nature and properties of the substance. \nStarch  is a carbon fiber, which breaks down relatively easily in an aqueous environment or it \ncan be broken down by enzymatic activity in the digestive system. In plants, starch serves as the \nenergy reservoir stored in seeds to ensure germination. When the seed is supplied as a foodstuff, \nstarch constitutes a good, rapidly available source of energy for the animal. Starch from different \nvegetative sources has slightly different properties. Wheat and barley starches break down \nrapidly in the rumen\u2019s aqueous environment and make major contributions as a source of energy \nfor microbial activity. Maize (corn) and sorghum starches break down slower and therefore, they \npersist longer, which means that most of the absorption of those starches into the body is through \nthe intestines where they serve as available energy sources. Fine chopping of maize and sorghum \ngrains into very small pieces increases the rate at which they are absorbed through the intestine.  \nCellulose , which has a basic structure similar to that of starch (C 6H12O6) n and hemicellulose (a \ndifferent chain, which contains a combination of 5 and 6 atoms of carbon) are more stable and \ntheir breakdown is dependent upon the populations of microorganisms in the rumen.  \nLignin  is another component in fiber, present in much lower quantities, but has a powerful effect \non both the plant and digestibility. Lignin is not a carbohydrate in the commonly accepted sense. \nLignin is a complex structure, or a chain of rings, some of which contain nitrogen. Lignin has a \nmuch more\n stable structure than cellulose and hemicellulose; lignin is not digested. (During the \ndiscussion of proteins, we will explain that anything which is not lignin, but is close to or and/or \nbound to lig\nnin such as the nitrogen in the rings, also has degraded digestibility). Lignin levels in \nplants rise with the plants\u2019 age; accordingly, young plants have much higher digestibility than \nmature plants, notwithstanding the fact that laboratory tests often characterize these fiber \ncomponents as carbohydrates; no difference is apparent between the different plants. Research \ninto lignin is somewhat problematic because we don\u2019t always know if it appears in specific \nlocations in the plant or is dispersed throughout the plant.

It is difficult to predict cell wall \ndigestibility using ADL when comparing plants which are botanically different.  \nApart from the ADL technique, there are other techniques that can be used to characterize lignin. \nThe alternative technique most often used is the KL test, which instead of trying to separate \nbetween lignin and cellulose using strong acid as in the ADL test, uses potassium permanganate \n(KMnO 4) to oxidize the ADF. When using this test, the results are higher than those received \nfrom the ADL test and that can be reasonably attributed to the nature of the test, which \nsuccessfully includes not only the non-digested fibers in the cell wall; it also comprises some of \nthe lignin that breaks down in an alkaline environment, which is the non-digested component \nfound inside the cell. Chemically, the difference between ADL and KL is that part of the lignin \ncomprised entirely from less stable materials (phenolic acids). In fact, the characterization of this \nlignin component can teach us more about plant dry matter digestibility when comparing \ndifferent plants, or the same plants from different plots of the same age. On the other hand, when \nexamining a specific plant at different growth stages and from different growing areas, it would \nseem that the ADL test suffices.  \nStarch and sugars constitute the cell-content carbohydrates and in the overall characterization, \nthey are usually defined as NSC (Non-Structural Components) with high solubility in the rumen. \nOn the other hand, in terms of the difference between the two lignin characterization methods, \nwe learn that not all cell content components are soluble, digestible and high in available energy \n\u2013 ADDL (Acid Detergent Dispersible Lignin).\nPredicting the digestibility of the cell wall using the ADDL technique is very significant in the \ncase of cereals and principally, in the case of cereals growing in and/or sourced from tropical \nareas. In contrast, when assessing legumes, the simpler and easier, ADL method is usually up to \nthe task. The next stage in the decoding of the secret of forage will be slightly more accurate and \nwill include\n as a matter of course, both the ADL and the KL tests.  \nDespite the limitations of the test, it would seem that in on the farm, regular measurement of \nADL levels could significantly improve the ability to provide the correct combination of the \nforages at our disposal. The negative effects of lignin on digestibility are not linear; lignin has an \naggregate effect. Therefore, a plant with a 4% ADL level is far less digestible than the same \nplant with a 2% ADL content (1% out of 2% lignin has less effect on the drop in digestibility \nthan 1% out of 4%). Thus, in the case of lignin rich foods in which the digestibility damage has \nalready been done, it doesn\u2019t matter if the lignin is 30% or 40% of the plant or even higher. The \nrange of interest to us and to which we must pay close attention, is between 2% and a maximum \nof 8% (it is standard practice to assess loss of digestibility at 2.4% for every 1% lignin).  \nCell wall digestibility (NDF) constitutes a core measurement in the prediction of ration \nefficiency for ruminants on milk yield.

Careful selection of the harvesting date for the varieties in regular use will achieve similar \nresults.  \nThe fiber tests described here constitute the basis for most of the research into nutrition.  \nUnfortunately, these tests do not provide enough detail about the various components of the \nplant.  It would seem that for the purposes of characterization of food at the farm level, the \nstandard NDF method described suffices for this purpose.  \nFor day to day life on the farm, it is not enough to know the chemical composition of the plant. \nIts physical structure and its ratio in the ration are of very considerable importance.  Researchers \nin Pennsylvania developed a sieving system, which can be used to characterize food fibers \naccording to length. When a fiber is shorter than 1.18mm, it will not be defined as effective, \nbecause it has no influence on rumen activity and the regurgitation of cud. It is important to \nemphasize that the effectiveness value found is also a relative figure and it is impossible to \ncompare between plant parts with an average length of 2cm and other parts with an average \nlength of 4cm, 6cm and more.  \nThe percentage of effective fibers in the food influences the consideration, which must be given \nto the overall cell wall data for that food and the degree to which it can influence digestion \nprocesses. Definition of food in \u201croughage units\u201d can help us understand this subject (the \ncalculation: Fiber longer than 1.18mm x %NDF). \nFor example: Whole crop cereal forage with an NDF of 65% and 98% long fibers, will have \n63.7% effective fibers. Using the same calculation, maize silage with an NDF of 50% contains \njust 41.5% effective fiber. Crushed soya husks, notwithstanding the fact that they have an NDF \nof 67%, had just 0.03% particles with a length of more 1.18mm and therefore, the level of \neffective fiber in this silage was a mere 2%. This issue is also important in grains. After physical \ntreatment and due to the nature of the grains, it was found that rolled barley contributes more \neffective fiber than finely ground maize grain, etc.  \nDespite the wish to determine an objective yardstick as is true for effective fiber, it was found \nthat two foods with identical fiber length, but a different cell wall composition will not behave in \nthe same way in the rumen, apparently because each food has a different breakdown rate in \naccordance with its composition and properties.  \nEffective NDF values can also be used as a measurement of rumen filling (Fill Value) and \ntherefore, it is standard procedure to apply this measurement to the different cow rations and \nwhen the NDF for the ration rises above 30%, the rumen fill value also rises. Consequently, both \nthe flow of digested products through the digestive system and food consumption drop.  \nAnother important consideration, which must be taken into account, is the region where the plant \nis grown.

Part of the protein survives the rumen and is whole when it \nreaches the intestines, where it is digested by the animal\u2019s enzymes. Some of the protein that \nsurvives the rumen can be degradable protein, which was not digested due to the rapid flow \nthrough the system. Protein reaching the intestine undergoes digestion by enzymes in a process \nsimilar to single stomach animals. Protein is not digested in its entirety in the intestine for a \nnumber of reasons: \n1. Due to the speed at which food is washed out of the rumen and passes through the\ndigestive system, the degradable protein can continue on and flow out in the feces. \n2. Protein bound to lignin (ADIN) cannot be utilized.\n To complete this process, it is important to mention the wear and tear caused by the passage of \nfood through the digestive system. Body protein worn away from the walls of the digestive \nsystem passageways, together with the enzymes secreted from the body, constitute between 3% \nand 5% of the nitrogen in the feces (metabolic fecal nitrogen) and the rougher the ration (straw) \nthe higher the quantity of nitrogen excreted.

To complete the picture of nitrogen balance in the body, we must \nmention the excretion of nitrogen in the urine, which is the byproduct of metabolic processes in \nthe body and not only the excess nitrogen excreted as urea. The quantity of metabolic waste \n(endogenic nitrogen) is not large, but must be taken into account when conducting digestion \nexperiments.    \nNotwithstanding the fact that food protein is essentially a carbon chain, it is an inefficient source \nof energy. Protein\u2019s vita l role in food is to build body tissues and help produce milk; it is not \nworthwhile to provide protein in food as a source of energy. Protein is an inefficient source of \nenergy because despite the fact that it is an energetic material, it breaks down into an \nintermediate material \u2013 non-protein nitrogen, which contains some of the energy intrinsic to the \nprotein (equivalent to some 1.25 Kilocalories for each gram of digested protein) and most of the \nnon-protein nitrogen is in the form of urea. Although rich in nitrogen like protein, the urea \nmolecule has no residual oxygen, which could to a degree, serve as a food substrate for the \nrumen populations to make microbial protein.  The residue comprises short chain molecules, \nwhich are absorbed to a not inconsiderable degree through the rumen walls into the bloodstream \nand they are not utilized either as a source of energy or as a source of nitrogen in the making of \nmicroorganism protein.

Rumen populations (assuming a ration \nbalanced for fiber and available energy) have the ability to exploit the two sources of protein that \nbreak down in the rumen for microbial protein. Unfortunately, this capability has limitations.  \nOne third of the protein supplied in the ration, which is the proportion that survives the rumen, is \nexploited by the animal using the enzymatic system and it does not exploit the non-utilizable \nprotein (ADIN).  \nFor any given nutritional composition in a ration, advanced models can be used to calculate the \ntotal amount of protein absorbed through the intestine, which comprises utilizable residual \nprotein and microbial protein. This combination, together with various models used to predict the \ncomposition and quantities of different amino acids absorbed into the body, expresses the real \nvalue of the protein in the food, which is then defined as Metabolic Protein \u2013 MP.  \nThe dairy farmer should plan the supply of protein in the ration by calculating the Metabolic \nProtein value of the food. Unfortunately, in many circumstances it can only be used for the \ntheoretical examination of the ration, using different models.  \n\u201cA veterinarian very interested in nutrition models once called me and asked:  \u2018If a ration for \ncalves needed no more than 12% overall protein to provide all the required Metabolic Protein, \nwh\ny are we wasting protein and providing 13% - 14% crude protein in the calf ration?\u2019 We met \nand together we examined an advanced model. It showed us very clearly that the link between \noverall protein and metabolic protein is a function of ration composition. In the case that we \nc\nhecked, by making only a few changes in the range of raw materials in the ration, we \nsuccessfully predicted identical production of metabolic pro tein (MP) in rations containing from \n12% to 19.5% crude protein.\u201d  \nAny discussion of protein quality and its contribution to ruminants cannot be limited solely to \nchemical characterization. It is always important to take a close look at the conditions, which \ncontribute towards the production of microbial protein. Available energy is a vital factor in the \nprocess. Different plants, such as legume forage, which has a high proportion of leaves, will \nencourage more vigorous production of microbial protein than various cakes, which are the main \nsponsored by the Israeli dairy School\nPage 21 of 28", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3351, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc03082a-52f8-4cce-baa1-d751060a707a": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc03082a-52f8-4cce-baa1-d751060a707a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "Dairy-Herd-Nutrition-Management_chapter_1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\TESLA LAPTOPS\\Documents\\llama_rag_project\\data\\Dairy-Herd-Nutrition-Management_chapter_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1190874, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b93e6427-7c9f-4924-9c0d-8611fb6702c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "Dairy-Herd-Nutrition-Management_chapter_1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\TESLA LAPTOPS\\Documents\\llama_rag_project\\data\\Dairy-Herd-Nutrition-Management_chapter_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1190874, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-20"}, "hash": "3fffc05a4aa7a5ea5d249b94c1a61972a8efd25e33d1ee43405d31d922617758", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "protein source in standard rations. For example: Soya protein breaks down in the rumen slower \nthan alfalfa protein. On the surface, that would imply that it is a better protein. In fact, it is the \nalfalfa protein, which contributes more to the production of microbial protein than the soya \nprotein. Therefore, the soya protein is exploited less efficiently, and relative large percentages of \nsoya protein pass into the bloodstream and the body as ammonia. During digestion experiments, \nit is included as digested material, but its artificial digestibility makes no contribution to the \nsupply of either energy or protein to the animal.  Such proteins even consume energy to expedite \nits excretion in the urine or in the milk. In other words, we can reasonably say that soya protein \n(and similar foods with greater effect, such as gluten feed and others) makes a relatively large \ncontribution to the artificial digestibility compartment.     \nThe nitrogen cycle within the body does not result in the excretion of all the surplus nitrogen in \nthe urine. Som\ne nitrogen returns through the saliva into the rumen. Nitrogen in the saliva joins \nthe overall nitrogen in the rumen, most of which comes from the food. Some of the nitrogen was \nin the food when it was consumed at the feeding trough (even alfalfa protein contains a certain \namount of ammonia). The remaining nitrogen, which is also the larger quantity, is real food \nnitrogen, which was broken down in the rumen because rumen microorganisms had neither the \nenergy nor sufficient time (due to fast breakdown rate and speed of digesta flow through the \ndigestive system) to use the ammonia to make microbial protein. \nMany of us now have a practical tool to estimate artificial digestibility \u2013measuring the quantity \nof urea in the milk. The starting point for this process is as explained above: The ammonia and \nnitrogen in the rumen not used to create microbial protein. As it continues, they enter body \ntissues, where they are transformed into urea. As the urea concentration in the blood rises, it \nmoves on and it is absorbed into the milk.  \nWhat have we learned from all this? \nA high concentration of urea in the milk is a characteristic indication of an imbalanced ration and \nprincipally, its lack of available energy for the efficient exploitation of the food protein, which \nbroke down in the rumen.  \nA high concentration of urea in the milk results from a too high concentration of protein in the \nration and at that concentration, the energy provided is insufficient to do all that required. (In \nfact, this is a waste of protein, together with an increase in heat load on the cow, which must \ninvest energy in the effort to remove surplus protein.)  \nA low concentration of urea in the milk is an excellent indication of a lack of food, due to a drop \nin consumption or merely a lack of protein.  \nDuring the hot summer days, when insufficient heat stress relief is provided or the cooling \nmethod is inefficient, there is a rise in respiration rate, food consumption drops and with it the \nsupply of energy. Consequentially, urea levels rise in the bloodstream and the milk.
